# Phaser island.js plugin
Phaser.io plugin for procedural generation and rendering island maps based on island.js (https://github.com/lebesnec/island.js)

# What I have done
I mostly just refactor render functions to get rid of paper.js dependency (phaser framework has own rendering system). I also added seed as config parameter so you can get same islands by it. Link: http://luckylooke.github.io/phaser-islandjs-plugin/

# Plans
Creating a game to show use of the plugin! :)

Collaboration welcomed!
